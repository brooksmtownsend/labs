      <description>Deploying a Stateless Golang App in Critical Stack Getting Started Before starting this lab, you will need:
 Go installed Visual Studio Code (or your favorite IDE) curl or some equivalent way to do GET and POST &amp;nbsp; (The Postman browser plugin is a good alternative). If using curl, python to make JSON prettier (you can also use jq) Docker installed Access to a public container registry, e.g. Docker Hub A Critical Stack deployment with a user account provisioned for you.</description>

      <description>Deploying a Stateless NodeJS App in Critical Stack This lab will walk you through the process of deploying a stateless NodeJS application to Critical Stack.
Getting Started Before we get started, you&amp;rsquo;ll need:
 Node JS (and npm) installed : Node.JS Docker installed : Docker Access to a public container registry (Docker Hub is easiest, Artifactory works too) : Docker Hub  Overview In this lab we will create a simple NodeJS application, deploy it via Critical Stack.</description>

      <description>Deploying a Stateless Golang App with REST API in Critical Stack Getting Started Before starting this lab, you will need:
 Go installed Visual Studio Code or your favorite IDE installed curl or some equivalent way to do GET and POST &amp;nbsp; (Postman is a good alternative) If using curl, python to make JSON prettier (you can also use jq) Docker installed. Access to a public container registry, e.g. Docker Hub Completed the Previous Go lab for the Docker registry and Load Balancer setup - this demo will just update the previous Docker image with new functionality  Overview In this lab, we will be enhancing the work done in the previous lab to introduce a RESTful API and walking through the steps necessary to build and deploy this to Critical Stack.</description>

      <description>Using Critical Stack to update a scalable, stateless application Getting Started Before starting on this lab, you will need to have completed the Previous Node lab.
Overview In the previous lab we created a simple NodeJS application, packaged the application in a docker image, pushed the docker image to a public docker image repository (Docker Hub), pulled that image into a Critical Stack deployment as a container instance, and accessed the application via a public URL.</description>
